This is my first attempt at creating a React-app. I also started playing with Bootsrap for this project. The BTC price is in realtime from https://bitcoinaverage-global-bitcoin-index-v1.p.rapidapi.com

This is very much a work in progress. 

Next on the list is adding the BTC the user "bought" to a variable called totalBtc.
